# MeshSDK with Cross Platform Bindings for MeshLib

The MeshSDK is an open-source library that provides advanced algorithms for 3D data processing. It assists developers and engineers in achieving precise results while delivering significant resource savings. Whether you are working on 3D printing, scanning, inspection, automation, robotics, scientific visualization, or medical devices, our 3D data processing library is ideally suited to meet your needs thanks to its potent capabilities and broad applicability. The SDK provides a robust foundation for 3D data processing, supporting all essential formats like point clouds, meshes, and volumes continuously generated by modern sensors. Our powerful half-edge data structure ensures manifold compliance for precise, reliable mesh representation. Plus, our repository includes clear code samples to help you get started quickly and explore advanced features with ease.

## Why Choose MeshSDK

**Fully Open Source.** You can also fork the code for your own unique use cases.

**Multi-Language Support.** Written in C++ with bindings for C, C#, and Python, our library integrates easily into AI pipelines and workflows.

**High Performance.** Internal benchmarks show up to 10x faster execution compared to alternative SDKs — especially in mesh boolean operations and simplification. [See performance data](https://meshlib.io/blog/).

**GPU-Accelerated Architecture.** Built with speed and scalability in mind, MeshSDK supports GPU acceleration and CUDA for high-performance computing.

**Cross-Platform Ready.** The SDK runs on Windows, macOS, Linux, and WebAssembly, offering flexibility for any development environment.

**Developer Support.** Get timely assistance from our responsive support team for integration, usage, or troubleshooting.

**Flexible Integration.** Use our toolkit as a standalone engine with UI components, or integrate selected algorithms into existing applications with minimal dependencies.

## Key Available Algorithms

- **3D Boolean** performs fast, highly optimized mesh- and voxel-based operations.
- **Mesh Repair** eliminates self-intersections, fills holes, and removes degeneracies.
- **Mesh Offsetting** controls surface thickness with multiple precise modes for 3D printing and machining.
- **Hole Filling** fills flat and curved surfaces, connects or separates holes, and builds bridges.
- **Mesh Simplification** optimizes mesh complexity while keeping details within set tolerance. We provide remeshing, and subdivision options as well.
- **Collision Detection** verifies intersections between models for further operations.
- **Extensive File Format Support** enables importing a wide range of file formats for meshes, point clouds, CT scans, polylines, distance maps, and G-code. Export functionalities—and support for color and texture data—are available for select formats, too (see the [full list for details](https://meshlib.io/feature/file-formats-supported-by-meshlib/)).
- **Triangulation** converts point clouds into meshes with accurate normal creation.
- **ICP** precisely aligns meshes using point-to-point and point-to-plane transformations.
- **Segmentation** performs semi-automatic segmentation based on curvature for meshes and voxels.
- **Deformation** applies Laplacian, freeform, and relaxation smoothing for fine mesh adjustments.
- **Support of Distance Maps and Polylines** allows to generate distance maps and iso-lines and performs projection and intersection.

## Development

### Linux & MacOS

```sh
git submodule update --init
./scripts/build_thirdparty.sh
./scripts/build_source.sh
```

### Docker

```sh
`docker compose up --build meshlib-emscripten-build`

`docker compose up meshlib-emscripten-build`
`docker compose up meshlib-emscripten-build -d`

`docker compose --profile singlethreaded up meshlib-emscripten-build-singlethreaded`
`docker compose --profile wasm64 up meshlib-emscripten-build-wasm64`

#
# To run custom build commands:
#
`docker compose exec meshlib-emscripten-build bash`
`docker compose exec meshlib-emscripten-build-singlethreaded bash`
`docker compose exec meshlib-emscripten-build-wasm64 bash`
```

### Windows

#### Prerequisites
 1. **Git**
  - [Install Git](https://git-scm.com/) to manage repositories and submodules, which is also required to install `vcpkg`.
 2. **Visual Studio 2019 or 2022**
  - [Download and install either Visual Studio 2019 or 2022](https://visualstudio.microsoft.com/). During installation, make sure to:
   - Select the "Desktop development with C++" workload.
   - Include support for the C++ programming language.
   - Ensure the English language pack is installed (required for `vcpkg`).
 3. **CUDA Toolkit**
  - For **Visual Studio 2019**: Install [CUDA v11.4](https://developer.nvidia.com/cuda-11-4-0-download-archive)
  - For **Visual Studio 2022**: Install [CUDA v12.0](https://developer.nvidia.com/cuda-12-0-0-download-archive)
 \n Choose the appropriate version based on your Visual Studio installation.
 4. **vcpkg**
  - To install `vcpkg`, follow these steps:
   1. **Open a command prompt (CMD) or PowerShell window**.
   2. **Navigate to a directory where you want to install** `vcpkg`:
```cmd
cd C:\path\to\your\desired\directory
```
   3. **Clone the** `vcpkg` **repository**:
```cmd
git clone https://github.com/microsoft/vcpkg.git
```
   4. **Navigate to the** `vcpkg` **directory**:
```cmd
cd vcpkg
git checkout 2024.10.21
```
If you're using **Visual Studio 2022**, you can use the latest version of vcpkg:
```cmd
git checkout 2025.04.09
```
The version `2024.10.21` is required only for compatibility with **Visual Studio 2019**.
   5. **Run the bootstrap script to build the** `vcpkg` **executable**:
```cmd
bootstrap-vcpkg.bat
```
   6. **Integrate** `vcpkg` **with Visual Studio (requires Administrator access)**:
```cmd
vcpkg integrate install
```

[Learn more about](https://github.com/Microsoft/vcpkg) `vcpkg`

#### Installing the local build
\note The following steps will require approximately 40 GB of disk space.

 1. **Clone the Submodules**:
```cmd
git submodule update --init
# or
git submodule update --init --recursive
```
 2. \b (Optional) **Speed Up with AWS CLI**
  - Optionally, [install AWS CLI v2](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/latest/userguide/getting-started-install.html) to speed up the process before using the Installation Script. Restart your terminal after installation.
 3. **Install Third-Party Dependencies**
  - Execute the following commands to run the third-party installation script:
```cmd
cd vcpkg
..\meshlib\thirdparty\install.bat
```
  - This script automates the installation of necessary third-party dependencies.
 4. **Build and Run Visual Studio Solution**
  - Open `meshlib/source/MeshLib.sln` in Visual Studio.
  - Build the solution and run the application.
 5. **Build and Run CMake Project**
  - Make sure you have the "C++ CMake tools for Windows" component installed.
  - Open `meshlib/CMakeLists.txt` in Visual Studio (File - Open - CMake).
  - Build the project and run the application.
