# How to implement scripts

Scripts enable the implementation of dynamic logic in editor-based applications. For each 3D object in the scene graph, it is possible to add one or more scripts.

## Lifecycle methods

Each script can implement the following lifecycle methods:

- `update()`: Executed right before a frame is going to be rendered. Its primary purpose is to update the state of the 3D object which owns the script. The method has an `event` parameter which holds a `time` and `delta` property. `time` represents the elapsed time in milliseconds and `delta` represents the time between two frames in milliseconds.
- `init()`: Executed once after the application has been loaded.
- `start()`: Executed once when the application is ready to start rendering.
- `stop()`: Executed once when the application is stopped.

## Events

It is also possible to implement event listeners for selected browser events. The following events are supported by the editor:

- `keydown`
- `keyup`
- `pointerdown`
- `pointerup`
- `pointermove`

## Script variables

Certain application components are accessible in the scope of scripts as variables:

- `player`: A reference to the application player (a wrapper component which executes the editor application).
- `renderer`: A reference to the renderer.
- `scene`: A reference to the scene graph.
- `camera`: A reference to the application's camera.

## Miscellaneous

- Code outside of lifecycle and event listeners is immediately executed when the script is loaded.
- The `this` reference can be used to refer to the 3D object which owns the script.
